    "about": " I am a passionate fullstack developer with over a year of professional experience, primarily focused on building scalable and efficient applications. Before embarking on my journey as a developer, I explored the world of data as a data scientist intern, where I honed my analytical skills and developed a keen eye for detail. This unique blend of experiences in startups has not only equipped me with a robust technical toolkit but also instilled a resilient problem-solving mindset. \n\nOutside of the digital realm, I find joy and relaxation in cricket, a sport that teaches me about teamwork and strategy. Music also plays a pivotal role in my life, providing a soundtrack to my coding sessions and downtime alike. My love for nature draws me to the serene and challenging landscapes of mountainous areas, where I often retreat to clear my mind and find inspiration. \n\nMy goal is to continue growing as a developer and innovator, utilizing my diverse skill set to contribute to meaningful projects that push technological boundaries. Whether coding, strategizing on the cricket field, or exploring new peaks, I am always on the path of personal and professional growth.",
